# CART 315 Exploration Prototype 1

<b>Design Hypothesis</b><br>

By presenting to the player a simple instruction to build a path, I believe that they can collect all the floating coins. So if I provide them the option to generate an unlimited amount of blocks, then the player will be able to create a path to go collect the coins. With the freedom the player will be given to build their path, will the user generate blocks to build something other than a way to to pick up all the coins?

<b>List of questions for playtesters</b>
<ul><li>Was the only instruction too vague? Were you confused and did not know what to do?</li>
  <li>What was the goal of this prototype?</li>
  <li>Was it easy to complete the goal?</li>
  <li>Did you decided to ignore the coins and build something with the blocks? If so, what did you build?</li>
  <li>Did you collect coins?</li>
  <li>Was it enjoyable? What did you enjoy or didn't enjoy about the prototype?</li>
